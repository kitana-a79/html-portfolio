<h2> J. </h2>

<p> I am a 21 year old in the USN.
   I have created this website as a part of my studying to become a full stack developer.
  In the Navy, I am an aviation mechanic. Its a cool job for what it is, however, over the course of the last 3 years 
  I have come to the realization this is not the career path I'd like to continue down. I am now
  studying full stack web development. I hope to learn web development 
  as a beginning to the software field and hope to get a bachelors in software engineering.
